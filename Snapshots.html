            This was our first gantt chart. It started in the second week of the project and ended once we had our client meeting.
            We felt this was a good time frame as this was our first big milestone, and we had to complete user requirements 
            and questions beforehand. This plan was achievable and we most of the deliverables seen. We did not start the risk register
            as we had not thought much about 
            However, looking back on our process, it would have been beneficial to create this plan earlier as we made it mid-week.

            This week we decided it was more beneficial to make a full representation of our full project in our gantt chart.
            This plan is likely to change as we are unsure of times and completion dates. We have included some dependencies, 
            i.e. we cannot start the implementation without the architectural diagrams. By this point we had our client meeting
            and we had finished the user requirements, after some guidance. 
            Not all tasks have been assigned to a team member as of yet as the tasks have not been fully broken down. 
            This week we made this plan quickly which
            was very beneficial. However, we need the plan to be more detailed.

            After a QnA session we realised it was beneficial to start the implementation even earlier than expected.
            This makes our project more parallel; implementation is less dependent on architecture. At this point we have still split
            ourselves into smaller teams to make the work more manageable. However, during in-person meeting we tend to work on
            tasks together instead. When we are away for the holiday period we expect to work more in our teams.

            It was harder to plan this weeks workload as the team is now remote due to the holiday period. 
            It was up to the individual groups to decide their course of action. The plan stayed the roughly same as in these weeks 
            there is just work to carry on with. The implementation team is nearer the beginning of their set of tasks. This means that the work
            that they plan to do this week is slightly more ambiguous. They hope to be able to get the design of the game more concrete 
            and then start to get some of the simple functionalities working.
